# [Creative Final Project: Phrase Colors]

A creative final project for Creative Web Development. This project was developed using the colord npm package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/colord) and created with HTML5, dart-sass, and JavaScript.

Phrase Colors is an interactive website where a user can type in a phrase and receive a color generated from what they typed. The site stores the last nine phrases and colors that the user generated, and displays their respective hexadecimal codes.

This project is meant to help bring fun to words, as well as to simmulate synesthesia (experiencing multiple senses at once, such as seeing colors when words are spoken).
